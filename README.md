# Bus

This project allows the user to enter a postocde, which is then validated, and displays information for the next five buses to arrive at the two bus stopes closest to the postcode entered. It makes use of the tfl api's and therefore only works within the Greater London area. 

## Set up
Run `npm install` to set up dependencies, and `npm start` to run the project.
